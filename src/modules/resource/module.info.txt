ResourceModule

This module wraps all functionality pertaining to uploading and querying resources.
Since V2 of the API, resources are uploaded by users, rather than hardcoded
into the API as they were in V1.

First, the program must create a schema associated with a resource that will
define the column names and data types of the incoming data. This is called
the 'data model', and needs to be generated for each resource.

Data model:
@see data-model.controller.ts for routes
@see data-model.service.ts for an injectable service describing what can be done

Once a data model has been generated, the "seeding" process can occur. The actual
data (cells) is uploaded using seed database, to be queried later using query database.

Resource:

@see resource.controller.ts for the routes related to uploading and downloading data
@see resource.service.ts for an injectable service describing what can be done with resources

Resource input validation
@see resource.validation.ts for input validation
@see resource-access-auth-guard.ts for a decorator that can be applied to routes to protect
against unauthorized resource requests
@see resource-exists.middleware.ts for a more efficient way to ensure an input is valid

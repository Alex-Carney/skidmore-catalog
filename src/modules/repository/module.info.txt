RepositoryModule

This module wraps all functionality pertaining to Repositories, which are a major component of the application.

A repository is essentially a folder to store data models, where operations pertaining to those data models are
only possible based on role based authentication control handled by the repository.

A user first creates a repository before uploading any data, and can configure the permissions of their data models
to other users by changing their permission level within the repository.

This module was completely designed and implemented by Alex

@see repository.controller.ts for all API routes pertaining to repository actions
@see repository.validation.ts for an injectable service that can be used by other modules to ensure that
input repositories are valid
@see repository.service.ts for the internal provider that updates the database based on user repository actions
@see repository-exists.middleware.ts for an injectable middleware to validate that an input repository exists (easier
than using repository validation everywhere)
@see repository-auth.guard.ts for a decorator that can be applied to API routes to ensure that the operation is allowed,
based on repository permission levels. Throws a 403 if it fails

Authentication Module

This module has no controller, therefore no explicit exposed routes. Instead, this
module stores the guards and services pertaining to authentication.

Note that the majority of this module was included in the starter project, and
not written by Alex

@see auth.service.ts for exported, injectable service for authentication
@see jwt-auth.guard.ts for an injectable guard that can be applied to API routes (to make
them require JWT authentication)

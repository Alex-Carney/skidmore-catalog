Prisma Module

Wraps the Prisma ORM into a module that can be imported as a dependency into required modules

Prisma handles the connection and object relational mapping to our PostgreSQL database

This module solely exists to wrap the prisma service into an injectable dependency

@see prisma.service.ts for the service that connects to the database
